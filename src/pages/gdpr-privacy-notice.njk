                    claims.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we
                reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is
                compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal data for an
                unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which we are
                using that allows us to do so. When required, we will ask your consent before starting
                among other marketing activities. Please note that even if you opt out from receiving
                marketing communications, you might still receive administrative, service or other
                important notices.</p>

            <p><strong>What legal basis do we have for processing your personal data?</strong></p>

            <p>As a rule our legal basis for the processing of personal data are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>your consent;</li>
                <li>performance of a contract;</li>
                <li>legal obligation; and</li>
                <li>our legitimate business interest.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This legal basis have been defined in the GDPR. We describe each of these below.</p>

            <p><u>Consent</u></p>

            <p>Should we want or need to rely on consent to lawfully process your data, we will request
                your written consent for the specific activity we require consent for and record your
                response on our system. Where consent is the lawful basis for our processing you have
                the right to withdraw your consent to this particular processing at any time (as set out
                below).</p>

            <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and we will cease to carry out
                the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there
                is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this
                purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.</p>

            <p><u>Performance of a contract</u></p>

            <p>We will rely on performance of a contract to provide you the services and manage
                relationships.</p>

            <p><u>Legal Obligation</u></p>

            <p>We will rely on legal obligation, if we are legally required to hold information on you
                to fulfil our legal obligations – including where you are placed in a role in a
                regulated environment. This would include the requirement to obtain and hold data
                regarding criminal convictions.</p>

            <p>This also concerns if EXELA would like to establish or defend it’s legal claims:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, where appropriate
                    and in accordance with local laws and requirements in connection with exercising or
                    defending legal claims or in case of carrying out other EXELA’s obligations;</li>
                <li>This may arise, for example; where we need to take legal advice in relation to legal
                    proceedings or are required by law to preserve or disclose certain information as
                    part of the legal process.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><u>Our Legitimate Business Interests</u></p>

            <p>Our legitimate business interest means processing of personal data is necessary to enable
                EXELA to conduct its business e.g. matters related to the protection of property,
                employees and matters related to providing security to persons present at premises. We
                never override fundamental rights and freedoms of our employees which require protection
                of personal data.</p>

            <p><u>Local Legislations and Regulations</u></p>

            <p>In certain cases, employment, financial (i.e. anti-money laundering) and other local
                legislation may require that we collect information that is considered to be ‘delicate’.
                In these circumstances we will ensure that only the minimum required is collected, and
                that it is securely stored and that it is deleted when no longer required.</p>

            <p>Below you can find examples of legal basis per type of processing which we may undertake:

            <p>EXELA being an international company processes data in locations both in the EEA or the
                UK and outside the EEA or the UK. We share your personal information with other entities

                    access. We limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents,

            <p><strong>Your rights in relation to personal data</strong></p>

            <p>Under the GDPR you have the right to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Request access to your personal information which involves confirming with us
                    whether we are processing your personal data and if we are, to request access to
                    that personal data including the categories of personal data processed, the purpose
                    of the processing and the recipients or categories of recipients. We do have to take
                    into account the interests of others though, so this is not an absolute right;</li>
                <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables
                    you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected or
                    deleted;</li>
                <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete
                    or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to
                    process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
                    information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below);
                </li>
                <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a
                    legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your
                    particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
                    You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information
                    for direct marketing purposes. To stop receiving marketing communications from us or
                    change your preferences please contact us on our local email address / contact
                    details;</li>
                <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you
                    to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example
                    if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</li>
                <li>Request the transfer of your personal information to another party in certain
                    formats, if practicable.</li>
                <li>Withdraw consent to processing at any time where we are relying on consent to
                    process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
                    processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your
                    consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will

                    be provided.</li>

                details of what information is to be provided.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of
                    the other rights), however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is
                    clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply
                    with your request in these circumstances;</li>
                <li>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your
                    identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of
                    your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not
                    disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to
                    ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our
                    response;</li>
                <li>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may
                    take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made
                    a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated;</li>
                <li>In certain circumstances we may need to limit the scope of the data subject’s rights
                    e.g. where a request is made to delete data that has to be retained for legal or
                    regulatory reasons, or where fulfilling the request may expose the personal data of
                    another data subject.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use of automated decision-making and profiling</strong></p>

            <p>We don’t undertake automated decision making, however we use profiling through our CRM
                systems. We do use our computer systems to search and identify personal data in
                accordance with parameters set by a person. A person will always be involved in the
                decision making process.</p>

            <p>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is
                sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is
                then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
                Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie
                will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless
                deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will
                expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</p>

            <p>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but
                personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in
                and obtained from cookies. We use both session and persistent cookies on our website.

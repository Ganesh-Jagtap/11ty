            <p>2.6<strong> Access.</strong> Exela agrees to provide access, at the request of Customer, and in the time and manner reasonably requested by the Customer, to Protected Health Information in a Designated Record Set, to Customer or, as directed by Customer, to an Individual.</p>

            <p><u><strong>3. Miscellaneous</strong></u></p>

            <p>3.1<strong> Effect of Termination.</strong></p>

            <p>(a) Upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, Exela will return or destroy all Protected Health Information received from the Customer, or created or received by Exela on behalf of Customer. This provision will apply to Protected Health Information that is in the possession of subcontractors of Exela.

            <p>(b) In the event that Exela determines that returning or destroying the Protected Health Information is infeasible, Exela will provide to Customer notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the parties that return or destruction of Protected Health Information is infeasible, Exela will extend the protections of this BAA to such Protected Health Information and limit further uses and disclosures of such Protected Health Information to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as Exela maintains such Protected Health Information.</p>

            <p>(c) In the event that Exela breaches its obligations under this BAA, Customer may, at its option, immediately and unilaterally terminate the Agreement without penalty to Customer, and with or without granting Exela an opportunity to cure the breach. Customer’s remedies under this paragraph and set forth elsewhere in this BAA, or in any other agreement between Customer and Exela, will be cumulative, and the exercise of any remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other.</p>

            <p>3.2<strong> Interpretation.</strong></p>

            <p>Any ambiguity in this BAA will be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits Customer to comply with HIPAA or the HITECH Act or any applicable regulations in regard to such laws.</p>
